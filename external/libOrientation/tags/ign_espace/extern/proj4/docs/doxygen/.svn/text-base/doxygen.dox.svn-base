NAME
       proj - forward cartographic projection filter
       invproj - inverse cartographic projection filter

SYNOPSIS
       proj [ -bceEfiIlmorsStTvVwW [ args ] ] [ +args ]
       file[s]
       invproj  [ -bceEfiIlmorsStTwW [ args ] ] [ +args
       ] file[s]

DESCRIPTION
       Proj and invproj perform respective forward  and
       inverse  transformation  of cartographic data to
       or from cartesian data  with  a  wide  range  of
       selectable projection functions.

       The  following  control parameters can appear in
       any order:

       -b     Special option for binary coordinate data
              input  and  output through standard input
              and standard output.  Data is assumed  to
              be  in  system type double floating point
              words.  This option is to  be  used  when
              proj  is a son process and allows bypassâ
              ing formatting operations.

       -i     Selects  binary  input   only   (see   -b
              option).

       -I     alternate  method to specify inverse proâ
              jection.   Redundant   when   used   with
              invproj.

       -o     Selects   binary   output  only  (see  -b
              option).

       -ta    A specifies a character employed  as  the
              first  character to denote a control line
              to be passed through without  processing.
              This  option  applicable  to  ascii input
              only.  (# is the default value).

       -e string
              String is an arbitrary string to be  outâ
              put  if  an error is detected during data
              transformations.  The default  value  is:
              *\t*.   Note  that  if  the  -b, -i or -o
              options  are  employed,   an   error   is
              returned   as  HUGE_VAL  value  for  both
              return values.

       -E     causes the input coordinates to be copied
              to  the output line prior to printing the
              converted values.

       -l[p|P|=|e|u|d]id
              List projection identifiers with -l,  -lp
              or  -lP  (expanded)  that can be selected
              with   +proj.    -l=id   gives   expanded
              description   of   projection  id.   List
              ellipsoid identifiers with -le, that  can
              be  selected  with  +ellps,  -lu  list of
              cartesian  to  meter  conversion  factors
              that  can  be selected with +units or -ld
              list of datums that can be selected  with
              +datum.

       -r     This  options  reverses  the order of the
              expected input from longitude-latitude or
              x-y to latitude-longitude or y-x.

       -s     This  options  reverses  the order of the
              output from x-y or longitude-latitude  to
              y-x or latitude-longitude.

       -S     Causes estimation of meridinal and paralâ
              lel scale factors, area scale factor  and
              angular distortion, and maximum and miniâ
              mum scale factors to be listed between <>
              for each input point.  For conformal proâ
              jections meridinal  and  parallel  scales
              factors will be equal and angular distorâ
              tion zero.  Equal area  projections  will
              have an area factor of 1.

       -m mult
              The  cartesian  data may be scaled by the
              mult parameter.  When processing data  in
              a  forward  projection mode the cartesian
              output values are multiplied by mult othâ
              erwise  the  input  cartesian  values are
              divided by mult  before  inverse  projecâ
              tion.   If  the  first  two characters of
              mult are 1/ or  1:  then  the  reciprocal
              value of mult is employed.

       -f format
              Format  is a printf format string to conâ
              trol the form of the output values.   For
              inverse  projections,  the output will be
              in degrees when this option is  employed.
              The  default format is "%.2f" for forward
              projection and DMS for inverse.

       -[w|W]n
              N is the number of significant fractional
              digits to employ for seconds output (when
              the  option  is  not  specified,  -w3  is
              assumed).  When -W is employed the fields
              will be constant width and  with  leading
              zeroes.

       -v     causes  a listing of cartographic control
              parameters tested for  and  used  by  the
              program  to  be  printed  prior  to input
              data.  Should not be  used  with  the  -T
              option.

       -V     This  option causes an expanded annotated
              listing of  the  characteristics  of  the
              projected point.  -v is implied with this
              option.

       -T ulow,uhi,vlow,vhi,res[,umax,vmax]
              This option creates a  set  of  bivariate
              Chebyshev  polynomial  coefficients  that
              approximate  the  selected   cartographic
              projection on stdout.  The values low and
              hi denote the range of  the  input  where
              the  u  or v prefixes apply to respective
              longitude-x or latitude-y depending  upon
              whether  a  forward or inverse projection
              is selected.  Res is  an  integer  number
              specifying  the  power of 10 precision of
              the approximation.  For example, a res of
              -3  specifies  an  approximation  with an
              accuracy better  than  .001.   Umax,  and
              vmax  specify maximum degree of the polyâ
              nomials   (default:   15).    See   also:
              fproj(1).

       The +args run-line arguments are associated with
       cartographic parameters and  usage  varies  with
       projection  and  for  a complete description see
       Cartographic Projection Procedures for the  UNIX
       EnvironmentâA  Userâs Manual ) and supplementary
       documentation for Release 4.

       Additional projection control parameters may  be
       contained  in  two auxilliary control files: the
       first  is   optionally   referenced   with   the
       +init=file:id and the second is always processed
       after the name of the projection has been estabâ
       lished  from either the run-line or the contents
       of  +init  file.   The   environment   parameter
       PROJ_LIB establishes the default directory for a
       file reference without an absolute  path.   This
       is  also  used  for  supporting files like datum
       shift files.

       One or more files (processed in  left  to  right
       order)  specify  the source of data to be transâ
       formed.  A - will specify the location  of  proâ
       cessing  standard input.  If no files are speciâ
       fied, the input is assumed  to  be  from  stdin.
       For ASCII input data the two data values must be
       in the first two white  space  separated  fields
       and  when  both  input  and output are ASCII all
       trailing portions of the input line are appended
       to the output line.

       Input  geographic  data (longitude and latitude)
       must be in DMS format and input  cartesian  data
       must  be  in units consistent with the ellipsoid
       major axis or sphere radius units.  Output  geoâ
       graphic  coordinates  will  be in DMS (if the -w
       switch is not employed) and  precise  to  0.001"
       with  trailing, zero-valued minute-second fields
       deleted.

EXAMPLE
       The following script
             proj +proj=utm  +lon_0=112w  +ellps=clrk66
            -r <<EOF
             45d15â33.1"   111.5W
             45d15.551666667N   -111d30
             +45.25919444444    111d30â000w
             EOF
       will perform UTM forward projection with a stanâ
       dard  UTM  central  meridian  nearest  longitude
       112Â°W.   The  geographic  values of this example
       are equivalent and meant as examples of  various
       forms  of  DMS  input.  The x-y output data will
       appear as three lines of:
             460769.27     5011648.45

OTHER PROGRAMS
       The  proj  program  is  limited  to   converting
       between  geographic  and  projection coordinates
       within one datum.

       The cs2cs program operates similarly, but allows
       translation  between any pair of definable coorâ
       dinate  systems,  including  support  for  datum
       translation.

       The  nad2nad  program  provides  for translation
       between  NAD27  and  NAD83  (also  available  in
       cs2cs) in a convenient manner.

       The geod program provides the ability to compute
       geodetic (Great Circle) computations.

NAME
       cs2cs - cartographic coordinate system filter

SYNOPSIS
       cs2cs [ -eEfIlrstvwW [ args ] ] [ +opts[=arg] ]
             [ +to [+opts[=arg]] ] file[s]

DESCRIPTION
       Cs2cs performs transformation between the source
       and destination cartographic  coordinate  system
       on a set of input points.  The coordinate system
       transformation can include  translation  between
       projected  and geographic coordinates as well as
       the application of datum shifts.

       The following control parameters can  appear  in
       any order:

       -I     method  to  specify  inverse translation,
              convert from +to coordinate system to the
              primary coordinate system defined.

       -ta    A  specifies  a character employed as the
              first character to denote a control  line
              to  be passed through without processing.
              This option  applicable  to  ascii  input
              only.  (# is the default value).

       -e string
              String  is an arbitrary string to be outâ
              put if an error is detected  during  data
              transformations.   The  default value is:
              *\t*.  Note that if  the  -b,  -i  or  -o
              options   are   employed,   an  error  is
              returned  as  HUGE_VAL  value  for   both
              return values.

       -E     causes the input coordinates to be copied
              to the output line prior to printing  the
              converted values.

       -l[p|P|=|e|u|d]id
              List  projection identifiers with -l, -lp
              or -lP (expanded) that  can  be  selected
              with   +proj.    -l=id   gives   expanded
              description  of  projection   id.    List
              ellipsoid  identifiers with -le, that can
              be selected  with  +ellps,  -lu  list  of
              cartesian  to  meter  conversion  factors
              that can be selected with +units  or  -ld
              list  of datums that can be selected with
              +datum.

       -r     This options reverses the  order  of  the
              expected input from longitude-latitude or
              x-y to latitude-longitude or y-x.

       -s     This options reverses the  order  of  the
              output  from x-y or longitude-latitude to
              y-x or latitude-longitude.

       -f format
              Format is a printf format string to  conâ
              trol  the form of the output values.  For
              inverse projections, the output  will  be
              in  degrees when this option is employed.
              If a format is specified for inverse proâ
              jection  the output data will be in deciâ
              mal  degrees.   The  default  format   is
              "%.2f" for forward projection and DMS for
              inverse.

       -[w|W]n
              N is the number of significant fractional
              digits to employ for seconds output (when
              the  option  is  not  specified,  -w3  is
              assumed).  When -W is employed the fields
              will be constant width and  with  leading
              zeroes.

       -v     causes  a listing of cartographic control
              parameters tested for  and  used  by  the
              program  to  be  printed  prior  to input
              data.  Should not be  used  with  the  -T
              option.

       The +args run-line arguments are associated with
       cartographic parameters and  usage  varies  with
       projection  and  for  a complete description see
       Cartographic Projection Procedures for the  UNIX
       EnvironmentâA  Userâs Manual ) and supplementary
       documentation for Release 4.

       The cs2cs program requires two coordinate system
       definitions.   The  first (or primary is defined
       based on all projection parameters not appearing
       after  the +to argument.  All projection parameâ
       ters appearing after the +to argument  are  conâ
       sidered  the definition of the second coordinate
       system.  If there is no second coordinate system
       defined, a geographic coordinate system based on
       the datum and ellipsoid of the source coordinate
       system  is  assumed.   Note  that the source and
       destination coordinate system can both  be  proâ
       jections, both be geographic, or one of each and
       may have the same or different datums.

       Additional projection control parameters may  be
       contained  in  two auxilliary control files: the
       first  is   optionally   referenced   with   the
       +init=file:id and the second is always processed
       after the name of the projection has been estabâ
       lished  from either the run-line or the contents
       of  +init  file.   The   environment   parameter
       PROJ_LIB establishes the default directory for a
       file reference without an absolute  path.   This
       is  also  used  for  supporting files like datum
       shift files.

       One or more files (processed in  left  to  right
       order)  specify  the source of data to be transâ
       formed.  A - will specify the location  of  proâ
       cessing  standard input.  If no files are speciâ
       fied, the input is assumed  to  be  from  stdin.
       For  input  data  the two data values must be in
       the first two white space separated  fields  and
       when  both input and output are ASCII all trailâ
       ing portions of the input line are  appended  to
       the output line.

       Input  geographic  data (longitude and latitude)
       must be in DMS format and input  cartesian  data
       must  be  in units consistent with the ellipsoid
       major axis or sphere radius units.  Output  geoâ

NAME
       geod - direct geodesic computations
       invgeod - inverse geodesic computations

SYNOPSIS
       geod  +ellps=<ellipse> [ -afFIlptwW [ args ] ] [
       +args ] file[s]
       invgeod +ellps=<ellipse> [ -afFIlptwW [ args ] ]
       [ +args ] file[s]

DESCRIPTION
       Geod  (direct)  and  invgeod  (inverse)  perform
       geodesic (Great Circle) computations for  deterâ
       mining latitude, longitude and back azimuth of a
       terminus point given a initial  point  latitude,
       longitude,  azimuth and distance (direct) or the
       forward and back azimuths and  distance  between
       an initial and terminus point latitudes and lonâ
       gitudes (inverse).

       The following  runline  control  parameters  can
       appear in any order:

       -I     Specifies  that the inverse geodesic comâ
              putation is to be performed.  May be used
              with  execution of goed as an alternative
              to invgeod execution.

       -a     Latitude and longitudes  of  the  initial
              and  terminal  points,  forward  and back
              azimuths and distance are output.

       -ta    A specifies a character employed  as  the
              first  character to denote a control line
              to be passed through without  processing.

       -le    Gives  a  listing  of  all the ellipsoids
              that may be  selected  with  the  +ellps=
              option.

       -lu    Gives a listing of all the units that may
              be selected with the +units= option.

       -[f|F] format
              Format is a printf format string to  conâ
              trol  the  output  form of the geographic
              coordinate values (f) or  distance  value
              (F).   The  default  mode is DMS for geoâ
              graphic coordinates and "%.3f"  for  disâ
              tance.

       -[w|W]n
              N is the number of significant fractional
              digits to employ for seconds output (when
              the  option  is  not  specified,  -w3  is
              assumed).  When -W is employed the fields
              will   be  constant  width  with  leading
              zeroes.

       -p     This option causes the  azimuthal  values
              to  be  output  as  unsigned  DMS numbers
              between 0 and 360 degrees.  Also note -f.

       The +args run-line arguments are associated with
       geodetic parameters for  specifying  the  ellipâ
       soidal or sphere to use.  See proj documentation
       for full list of these  parameters  and  contrl.
       The options are processed in left to right order
       from the run line.   Reentry  of  an  option  is
       ignored  with  the first occurance assumed to be
       the desired value.

       One or more files (processed in  left  to  right
       order)  specify  the source of data to be transâ
       formed.  A - will specify the location  of  proâ
       cessing  standard input.  If no files are speciâ
       fied, the input is assumed to be from stdin.

       For direct determinations input data must be  in
       latitude,  longitude, azimuth and distance order
       and output will be latitude, longitude and  back
       azimuth of the terminus point.  Latitude, longiâ
       tude of the initial and terminus point are input
       for  the inverse mode and respective forward and
       back  azimuth  from  the  initial  and  terminus
       points   are  output  along  with  the  distance
       between the points.

       Input geographic coordinates (latitude and  lonâ
       gitude) and azimuthal data must be in DMS format
       and input distance data must be in units consisâ
       tent  with  the  ellipsoid  major axis or sphere
       radius  units.   Output  geographic  coordinates
       will  be  in  DMS  (if  the  -f  switch  is  not
       employed) to 0.001" with  trailing,  zero-valued
       minute-second  fields  deleted.  Output distance
       data will be in the same units as the  ellipsoid
       or sphere radius.

       The  Earthâs  ellipsoidal figure may be selected
       in the same manner  as  program  proj  by  using
       +ellps=, +a=, +es=, etc.

       Geod  may also be used to determine intermediate
       points along either a geodesic line between  two
       points  or  along  an  arc of specified distance
       from a geographic point.  In both cases an  iniâ
       tial point must be specified with +lat_1=lat and
       +lon_1=lon  parameters  and  either  a  terminus
       point  +lat_2=lat  and  +lon_2=lon or a distance
       and azimuth from the initial point with  +S=disâ
       tance and +A=azimuth must be specified.

       If  points along a geodesic are to be determined
       then either +n_S=integer specifying  the  number
       of  intermediate  points  and/or +del_S=distance
       specifying  the  incremental  distance   between
       points must be specified.

       To  determine  points  along  an arc equidistant
       from the initial  point  both  +del_A=angle  and
       +n_A=integer  must  be specified which determine
       the respective angular increments and number  of
       points to be determined.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  script  determines  the geodesic
       azimuths and distance in U.S. stature miles from
       Boston, MA, to Portland, OR:
             geod +ellps=clrk66 <<EOF -I +units=us-mi
             42d15âN 71d07âW 45d31âN 123d41âW
             EOF
       which gives the results:
             -66d31â50.141"   75d39â13.083"   2587.504
       where  the first two values are the azimuth from
       Boston to Portland, the back azimuth from  Portâ
       land to Boston followed by the distance.

       An example of forward geodesic use is to use the
       Boston location and determine  Portlandâs  locaâ
       tion by azimuth and distance:
             geod +ellps=clrk66 <<EOF +units=us-mi
             42d15âN 71d07âW -66d31â50.141" 2587.504
             EOF
       which gives:
             45d31â0.003"N              123d40â59.985"W
            75d39â13.094"
       Note: lack of precision in  the  distance  value
       compromises  the precision of the Portland locaâ
       tion.

	\section param1 False Easting/Northing
Virtually all coordinate systems allow for the presence of a false easting (+x_0) and northing (+y_0). 
Note that these values are always expressed in meters even if the coordinate system is some other units. 
Some coordinate systems (such as UTM) have implicit false easting and northing values.

	\section param2 pm - Prime Meridian
A prime meridian may be declared indicating the offset between the prime meridian of the declared coordinate system and that of greenwich.
A prime meridian is clared using the "pm" parameter, and may be assigned a symbolic name, or the longitude of the alternative prime meridian relative to greenwich.
Currently prime meridian declarations are only utilized by the pj_transform() API call, not the pj_inv() and pj_fwd() calls. 
Consequently the user utility cs2cs does honour prime meridians but the proj user utility ignores them.
The following predeclared prime meridian names are supported. These can be listed using the cs2cs argument lm.

\section param3 towgs84 - Datum transformation to WGS84
Datum shifts can be approximated by 3 parameter spatial translations (in geocentric space), or 7 parameter shifts 
(translation + rotation + scaling). The parameters to describe this can be described using the towgs84 parameter.
\subsection threeparam 3 parameters datum transformation
In the three parameter case, the three arguments are the translations to the geocentric location in meters.
For instance, the following demonstrates converting from the Greek GGRS87 datum to WGS84.
\verbatim
